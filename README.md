# react-dynamic-help-demo
Demo of how to use https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dynamic-help

This is an app such as one might use for generating role-playing character stats ... with a _deliberately_ obtuse interface, and some dynamic help to assist.

See it running here: https://greenasjade.github.io/react-dynamic-help-demo/

(This demo is tested on react-dynamic-help v2.4.3)
